# Hex Guessing Game

This is a minimalist app that allows the user to practice guessing hex color codes. The purpose is to enable oneself to more easily determine the approximate hex code of a given color, and also to determine what a color will look like based on its hex.

This project was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNYljS0_TOE&t=879s), which is a React.js implementation of the same game.

## How To Play

A color will appear in the large central box, and your job is to guess the hex color code associated with it. You will be given three options, and should aim to click the button with the correct hex code on it.

If you guess incorrectly, you will be asked to try again. If you guess the hex correctly, then the color will change and you will get to play again, if you so choose.

## Tools Used

I created this app using Vite, TypeScript, and JQuery. Using JQuery was probably unnecessary for a project this small, but I wanted to ensure that I had reasonable familiarity with it nonetheless.
